You need to have gwt installed on your system to work with this Project.

If you have gwt installed you need to set some environment variables.
On unix-like systems you do soething like:

export GWT_HOME=/path...
export GWT_DEV=gwt-dev-mac.jar
export CATALINA_HOME=/path to you tomcat folder
# Optional if your running Mac OS:
export GWT_PLATTFORM_FLAGS=-XstartOnFirstThread

Maybe copy the lines above into some bash script, so you don't need to enter the
commands line by line.
