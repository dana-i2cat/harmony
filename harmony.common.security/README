IST Phosphorus Harmony Security
===============================

1.) ant prepare
2.) Look at README.1st


What the GAAA-tk needs
======================

1. Write access to a directory called: "_aaadata/tmp"

Creating own Certs
==================
1) You need to create a privatekey:
	
	openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:<passwd> -out <keyname>.pem <512/1024/2048>
	
2) Then, you create a self-signed cert:

	openssl req -new -x509 -key <keyname>.pem -out <certname>.pem -days 1095
	
3) Convert both, private key and cert to DER format:

	openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in <keyname>.pem -inform PEM -out <keyname>.der -outform DER
	openssl x509 -in <certname>.pem -inform PEM -out <certname>.der -outform DER

4) Import both into a Java Keystore. This can't be done by Keytool, you need to
	use external tools like for example: 
	http://www.agentbob.info/agentbob/80/version/default/part/AttachmentData/data/ImportKey.java
	
	With this tool, you do:
	
	javac ImportKey.java
	java ImportKey <keyname>.der <certname>.der
	
5) Finally you'll find everything you need in a java keystore. Now you can change
	the keystore password, alias, and cert key with keytool.
	
6) Now You are able to use your new keystore with the security module. Just
	enter all needed configuration data into your local aai properties file.


Using your brand-new cert
=========================
Since you have successfully created your own cert, the server needs to know
about you.

The user-identifiaction process works via the CN field of the used Certificate.
So your username is the name from the Cert. For any incoming request, the server
will check the group the user belongs to. For this, a property file named
groups.properties located in resources/properties is used. So that the server
can map your username to a group, you need to put yourself into this property
file and map your CN name to a group. Blanks are deleted for keys in the property
file.

Now, you're ready to use your cert for any further requests!

PLEASE NOTE: The users and groups.properties can be seen by anyone!
This is why you should think about creating local properties. To learn more
about how to use local properties and their benefits, please have a look at 
the file README.1st
